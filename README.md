# cayley_graphs

the purpose of this project is to create a series of python classes in order to generate the cayley graphs of group objects

i have all of my classes consolidated in one file for referencing, which i know is dumb but is what it is. 

whiteboard changes all of the time because it is just where i start to work on things before i move it to other files. e

everything one ought to need is in the master file, including the graphing aspect which is being added presently
